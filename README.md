# trafficbot.sh
This little script is used at student dorm at TU Dortmund.
It can run on every piece of equipment capable of running `bash`.

To use it, get Telegram and create a bot.
Get the bots `TOKEN` and your own `CHAT_ID` and export it in your shell
or change the corresponding lines in the script.

Writing the bot "`/traffic`" will yield your remaining traffic as an answer.

Enjoy!
